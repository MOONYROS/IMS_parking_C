# IMS project (2023)

The goal of this project was to create a simulation program.

I tried to create a cellular automata of a shopping centre parking lot. Each cell represents one parking spots.
Through the time, cars arrive a depart from the parking lot. 
My goal was to experiment with different arrival and departure periods and try to create an ideal parking lot.
